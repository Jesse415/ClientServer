# ClientServer
The client server program is a linux based program. The idea is that the server is on another computer
and the client is on say a host computer. When both programs are ran the client side can make request
to show what is in that directory that the server is located on. To transfer a file. Also, to show the
information of the computers specs. Can be compiled for windows but the functionality is still in 
production.
